# Larry Ipsum

## Background
Larry Ipsum is a dashboard web application that generates a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document without relying on meaningful content. This project is a colorful play on an inside joke from the Fall 2019 session of the University of New Hampshire Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, in which wherever there is a need for an arbitrary variable during a lesson, that variable be named "Larry".
